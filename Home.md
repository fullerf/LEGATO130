## Documentation for KD Scientific Legato 130 EPICS ioc

__Project Description__: We're aiming to create an ioc which presents process variables (PVs) to a LAN that allow one to remotely operate a KDS Legato 130 syringe pump.  This basically acts as a wrapper to the existing SCPI command system that the device already has.
